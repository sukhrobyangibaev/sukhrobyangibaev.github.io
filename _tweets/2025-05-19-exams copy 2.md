Everyone thinks exam season is toughest for students. But honestly, it’s the worst time of year for teachers.

You get bombarded with requests to adjust their grades. Why are you even asking? Just take what you earned and do better next time. Stop skipping life lessons, and pay the price while it’s still cheap.

What’s worse is when you decline a student’s request, and suddenly you’re dealing not just with the student, but their parents, siblings, relatives, even other teachers.

Absolutely the worst part of the year.

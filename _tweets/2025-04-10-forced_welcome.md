Let employees say 'no' to extra tasks, like meeting visitors. 

No disrespect intended - I just can't fake enthusiasm for certain tasks, and I end up hating myself afterward. 

I am willing to give back my pay for those hours, no problem. You can use that money to pay someone who wants to do it. 

It's not that I have excess money to throw around (I'm just a part-time employee), but I'm willing to pay a reasonable amount to compensate those who actually enjoy and are willing to do that job.

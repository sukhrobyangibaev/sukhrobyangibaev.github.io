# Tasks for Practical Class 1: PostgreSQL Installation and Connection

**Objective:** To successfully install PostgreSQL, connect to it using both SQL Shell (psql) and pgAdmin 4, and perform basic verification steps.

**Instructions:** Please complete the following tasks and take **full-screen screenshots** as indicated to demonstrate your progress.  **Ensure your screenshot shows the entire screen, including the taskbar and any open windows.** This helps verify you are working on your own computer.

## Installation Verification

1.  **Install PostgreSQL:**
    *   Follow the provided guide (your class material) to install PostgreSQL on your computer.
    *   **Task 1 (Full-Screen Screenshot):** After the installation is complete, open the Start Menu (or your operating system's application launcher).  Search for "PostgreSQL" and take a **full-screen screenshot** showing the PostgreSQL folder and/or icons (like "pgAdmin 4", "SQL Shell (psql)") listed in the Start Menu. This confirms PostgreSQL is installed on your system.

2.  **Connect using SQL Shell (psql):**
    *   Open SQL Shell (psql) from the Start Menu (or application launcher).
    *   Connect to the PostgreSQL server using the default settings (Server: `localhost`, Database: `postgres`, Port: `5432`, Username: `postgres`) and the password you chose during installation.
    *   **Task 2 (Full-Screen Screenshot):** Take a **full-screen screenshot** showing the `postgres=#` prompt in the SQL Shell, indicating a successful connection.

3.  **Connect using pgAdmin 4:**
    *   Open pgAdmin 4 from the Start Menu (or application launcher).
    *   Connect to the PostgreSQL server using the password you chose during installation.
    *   **Task 3 (Full-Screen Screenshot):** Take a **full-screen screenshot** showing the pgAdmin 4 interface with the connected server and the `postgres` database visible in the Object explorer (usually on the left side).  Make sure the entire pgAdmin 4 window is visible in the screenshot.

4.  **Verify PostgreSQL Version:**
    *   In **SQL Shell (psql)**, execute the following SQL command:
        ```sql
        SELECT version();
        ```
    *   **Task 4 (Full-Screen Screenshot):** Take a **full-screen screenshot** showing the output of the `SELECT version();` command in SQL Shell. Ensure the entire SQL Shell window is visible.
    *   In **pgAdmin 4**, open the Query Tool for the `postgres` database (right-click on `postgres` database -> Query Tool).
    *   In the Query Tool, execute the same SQL command:
        ```sql
        SELECT version();
        ```
    *   **Task 5 (Full-Screen Screenshot):** Take a **full-screen screenshot** showing the output of the `SELECT version();` command in pgAdmin 4's Query Tool. Ensure the entire pgAdmin 4 window and the Query Tool are visible.


**Submission:**
*   After completing all tasks, create a **Google Document**.
*   **Insert each screenshot** into the Google Document, clearly labeling each screenshot with the corresponding Task number (e.g., "Task 1 Screenshot", "Task 2 Screenshot", etc.).
*   **To insert a screenshot into Google Docs:** You can usually copy the screenshot to your clipboard (using the Print Screen key, or Snipping Tool/Screenshot tool) and then paste it directly into the Google Doc (Ctrl+V). Alternatively, you can save the screenshot as an image file and then use "Insert" -> "Image" -> "Upload from computer" in Google Docs.
*   **Example Google Document:** [example google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19sulXy7SxGjuOdvLj1h0KOGSVxHN2LCXNk_iL8P3V7E/edit?usp=sharing)
*   After completing all tasks and inserting screenshots into your Google Document:
    1.  **Share your Google Document:**
        *   Click the **"Share" button** located at the top right corner of your Google Document.
        *   In the "Share with people and groups" window, find the section about link sharing (it might be labeled "Get link" or similar).
        *   Click on the **"Change"** link next to "Restricted" (or the current sharing setting). This will open the link sharing settings.
        *   In the dropdown menu, change the setting from **"Restricted" to "Anyone with the link"**.
        *   Click on the dropdown menu next to "Anyone with the link" and change the role from **"Viewer" to "Commenter"**.  This allows your teacher to provide feedback directly on your document.
        *   Click **"Copy link"**.
        *   Click **"Done"**.
	1.  **Submit the Google Doc Link:**
        *   Open the provided Google Sheets link: [google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D5CNHZo12ka4Ax5iHL2mvwyDa_pVIzp0I8Heh-P5yxI/edit?usp=sharing)
        *   Find your name (or the designated row for you) in the Google Sheet.
        *   In the appropriate column (labeled "Solution" or similar), **paste the link** you just copied from your Google Document (right click -> comment).

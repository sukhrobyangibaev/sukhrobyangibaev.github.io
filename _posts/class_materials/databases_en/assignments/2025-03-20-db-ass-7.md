<details markdown="1">
<summary><strong>Variant 1: E-commerce Products and Categories</strong></summary>

**Scenario:** A simplified e-commerce system needs to categorize products.

**Database Schema:**

**Tables:** `products`, `categories`

```sql
CREATE TABLE categories (
    category_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    category_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    description TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    category_id INTEGER REFERENCES categories(category_id)
);
```

**Sample Data:**

```sql
INSERT INTO categories (category_name, description) VALUES
('Electronics', 'Electronic devices and gadgets'),
('Books', 'Literary works and publications'),
('Clothing', 'Apparel and fashion items'),
('Home Goods', 'Items for household use');

INSERT INTO products (product_name, price, category_id) VALUES
('Laptop', 1200.00, 1),
('Smartphone', 800.00, 1),
('T-Shirt', 25.00, 3),
('Novel - Mystery', 15.00, 2),
('Cookbook', 20.00, 2),
('Jeans', 60.00, 3),
('Coffee Maker', 45.00, NULL),
('Tablet', 300.00, 1),
('Pillow', 25.00, NULL);
```

**Tasks:**

1.  Using `INNER JOIN`, list product names and their corresponding category names.
2.  Using `LEFT JOIN`, show all categories and the product names within each category. If a category has no products, the product name should be `NULL`.
3.  Using `RIGHT JOIN`, list all products and their category names. Consider if there's a difference from `INNER JOIN` here, and explain why or why not.
4.  Using `FULL OUTER JOIN`, combine categories and products. Analyze the result and explain what this type of join highlights in this context.
5.  Using `CROSS JOIN`, generate all combinations of categories and products. Explain a scenario where `CROSS JOIN` could be useful here.
6.  Using `INNER JOIN` with a `WHERE` clause, find product names and prices for products in the 'Electronics' category.
7.  Using `LEFT JOIN` and a `WHERE` clause, show all categories and product names but only for products priced over $50. If a category has no such products, show NULL.
8.  Using `INNER JOIN`, find product names and category names, ordering the result by product price in descending order.
9.  Using `LEFT JOIN`, count the number of products in each category. Display category name and the count. (Hint: You might need to use aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` after the join).
10. Using `RIGHT JOIN`, list all products and their category names, including products that might not be assigned to any category (assuming you add such data). If a product has no category, show category name as 'Uncategorized'. (For this task, you might need to slightly modify the data to include a product without a category for RIGHT JOIN to be distinctly different from INNER JOIN).

<summary><strong>Variant 2: Library Patrons and Books</strong></summary>

**Scenario:** A library system tracks patrons and the books they are interested in (wishlist).

**Database Schema:**

**Tables:** `patrons`, `wishlist_books`

```sql
CREATE TABLE patrons (
    patron_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    patron_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    library_card_number VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE,
    city VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE wishlist_books (
    wishlist_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    patron_id INTEGER REFERENCES patrons(patron_id),
    book_title VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(100)
);
```

**Sample Data:**

```sql
INSERT INTO patrons (patron_name, library_card_number, city) VALUES
('Alice Reader', 'LC123', 'New York'),
('Bob PageTurner', 'LC456', 'Los Angeles'),
('Charlie Bookworm', 'LC789', 'Chicago'),
('Diana LibraryFan', 'LC101', 'Houston'),
('Eve Novelist', 'LC112', 'New York'),
('Frank Fictional', 'LC131', 'Los Angeles');

INSERT INTO wishlist_books (patron_id, book_title, author) VALUES
(1, 'The Secret Garden', 'Frances Hodgson Burnett'),
(NULL, 'Pride and Prejudice', 'Jane Austen'),
(1, 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Harper Lee'),
(3, '1984', 'George Orwell'),
(4, 'The Great Gatsby', 'F. Scott Fitzgerald'),
(NULL, 'Jane Eyre', 'Charlotte BrontÃ«'),
(5, 'Moby Dick', 'Herman Melville'),
(6, 'Little Women', 'Louisa May Alcott');
```

**Tasks:**

1.  Using `INNER JOIN`, retrieve a list of patron names and the titles of books on their wishlists.
2.  Using `LEFT JOIN`, show all patrons and the book titles on their wishlists. If a patron has no books on their wishlist, the book title should be `NULL`.
3.  Using `RIGHT JOIN`, list all wishlist books and the names of the patrons who wishlisted them. Is there a practical difference from `INNER JOIN` in this case? Explain.
4.  Using `FULL OUTER JOIN`, combine patrons and wishlist books. Analyze the result and what it represents.
5.  Using `CROSS JOIN`, generate all combinations of patrons and wishlist books. Discuss potential uses for `CROSS JOIN` in a library wishlist context.
6.  Using `INNER JOIN` with a `WHERE` clause, find patron names and book titles for wishlisted books authored by 'Jane Austen'.
7.  Using `LEFT JOIN` and a `WHERE` clause, show all patrons and book titles, but only for books titled starting with 'The'. If a patron has no such books, show NULL.
8.  Using `INNER JOIN`, find patron names and wishlist book titles, ordering the result by patron name alphabetically.
9.  Using `LEFT JOIN`, count how many books are on each patron's wishlist. Display patron name and the count.
10. Using `RIGHT JOIN`, list all wishlist books and the patron names, including wishlist entries that might not have a corresponding patron (assuming data inconsistency). If a wishlist book has no patron, show patron name as 'Unknown Patron'. (For this task, you might need to slightly modify the data to include a wishlist book with a non-existent patron_id for RIGHT JOIN to be distinctly different).

<summary><strong>Variant 3: Social Media Users and Activities</strong></summary>

**Scenario:** A simplified social media platform tracks users and their activities (likes).

**Database Schema:**

**Tables:** `users`, `activities`

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    city VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE activities (
    activity_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id),
    activity_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- e.g., 'post_like', 'comment', 'follow'
    activity_timestamp TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Sample Data:**

```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, city) VALUES
('NetizenNick', 'London'),
('SocialSam', 'Paris'),
('OnlineOlivia', 'New York'),
('DigitalDan', 'London'),
('TechTina', 'San Francisco'),
('GlobalGreg', 'Tokyo');

INSERT INTO activities (user_id, activity_type) VALUES
(1, 'post_like'),
(NULL, 'comment'),
(1, 'follow'),
(3, 'post_like'),
(4, 'post_like'),
(NULL, 'follow'),
(5, 'comment'),
(6, 'post_like'),
(3, 'follow');
```

**Tasks:**

1.  Using `INNER JOIN`, retrieve usernames and their activity types.
2.  Using `LEFT JOIN`, show all users and their activity types. If a user has no activities, the activity type should be `NULL`.
3.  Using `RIGHT JOIN`, list all activities and the usernames of the users who performed them.  Explain if `RIGHT JOIN` offers different insights than `INNER JOIN` here.
4.  Using `FULL OUTER JOIN`, combine users and activities. Analyze the result and consider its relevance in understanding user engagement.
5.  Using `CROSS JOIN`, generate all combinations of users and activities. Discuss a potential, even if unlikely, use case for `CROSS JOIN` in social media activity analysis.
6.  Using `INNER JOIN` with a `WHERE` clause, find usernames and activity types for activities of type 'post_like'.
7.  Using `LEFT JOIN` and a `WHERE` clause`, show all users and activity types, but only for activities that happened in the last 24 hours (you might need to adjust sample data or use date functions). If no recent activity, show NULL.
8.  Using `INNER JOIN`, find usernames and activity types, ordering the result by username alphabetically.
9.  Using `LEFT JOIN`, count the number of activities for each user. Display username and the count of activities.
10. Using `RIGHT JOIN`, list all activities and usernames, including activities that might be linked to a non-existent user (assuming data inconsistency). If an activity has no user, show username as 'Unknown User'. (For this, you would need to insert an activity with a non-existing `user_id` for `RIGHT JOIN` to show a distinct result).

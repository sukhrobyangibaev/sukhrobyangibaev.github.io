## Using pgAdmin 4 ERD Tool

---

### Task:

1.  Using pgAdmin 4 ERD Tool, create a new ERD project.
2.  Create the tables as defined in the schema, specifying appropriate data types and primary keys.
3.  Establish the relationships between the tables by creating foreign keys as indicated. Use the "one-to-many" relationship tool for each foreign key constraint. 
4.  Auto-align the tables for better readability.
5.  Generate the SQL DDL script for this database schema.
6.  Save your ERD project.

### Submission Instructions:

**Step 1: Capture a High-Quality Screenshot of Your ER Diagram**

1.  **Maximize ERD Canvas:** In pgAdmin 4, ensure your entire ER Diagram is visible on the screen. You might need to zoom out slightly or use the "Auto Align" feature again to ensure all tables and relationships are clearly displayed and not overlapping or cut off.

![](/assets/images/2025-02-12-db-ass-2/Pasted%20image%2020250212163907.png)

1.  **Take a Screenshot:** Capture a screenshot of your entire pgAdmin 4 window, clearly showing the ER Diagram you have created.
2.  **Review Screenshot Quality:** Open the screenshot and verify that:
    *   The entire ER Diagram is visible.
    *   Table names, column names, data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships are clearly readable.
    *   The screenshot is not blurry or pixelated. If it's unclear, retake the screenshot.
3.  **Save the Screenshot:** Save the screenshot as an image file (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`). Name the file informatively, such as 
	`Variant[Variant Number]_ERD_Screenshot_[YourLastName]_[YourFirstName].png` 
	(e.g., `Variant1_ERD_Screenshot_Smith_John.png`).

**Step 2: Upload Screenshot to Google Drive**
1.  **Open Google Drive:** Go to your Google Drive account in a web browser.
2.  **Navigate to Submission Folder (Optional but Recommended):**  You may want to create a new folder in your Google Drive specifically for this Databases course or assignment submissions to keep things organized.
3.  **Upload File:** Click the "+ New" button (or "Upload") and select "File upload". Choose the screenshot image file you saved in Step 7. Wait for the upload to complete.

**Step 3:  Set Share Permissions for the Screenshot on Google Drive**
1.  **Locate Uploaded File:** Find the screenshot file you just uploaded in your Google Drive.
2.  **Get Shareable Link:** Right-click on the screenshot file and select "Get link" (or "Share").
3.  **Change Link Settings:** In the sharing dialog that appears, click on "Change" next to "Restricted" (or the current access setting).
4.  **Select "Anyone with the link":** Choose the option "Anyone with the link" from the dropdown menu.
5.  **Set Permission to "Viewer":** Ensure the permission is set to "Viewer" (it should be by default).
6.  **Copy Link:** Click the "Copy link" button. The link to your screenshot is now copied to your clipboard.
7.  **Click "Done":** Close the sharing dialog.

**Step 4: Submit the Google Drive Link in Google Sheets**

8.  **Open the Google Sheet:** [google sheets for this task](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VSEN1fhtZhiva10G9-lutFp8FfM-HOdoIxEQ4kydUho/edit?usp=sharing)
9.  **Find Your Row:** Locate your name or student ID in the first column of the Google Sheet. Your submission cell will be in the corresponding row.
10.  **Insert Link as a Comment:**
    *   Click on the cell designated for your submission.
    *   Right-click on the cell and select "Insert comment" (or "Comment").
    *   **Paste the Google Drive link** you copied in Step 3 into the comment box.
    *   Click "Comment" or the "Post" button to save the comment with the link.
11.  **Verify Submission:** Double-check that your comment is visible in the cell and that you've pasted the link correctly.

**Important Reminders:**

*   **Ensure "Anyone with the link can view" access is set on Google Drive.** If this is not set correctly, your teacher will not be able to see your screenshot.
*   **Test your link!**  Open the link in a private browsing window or on a different device to confirm it works as expected and displays your screenshot.
*   **Submit by the deadline.** Check the assignment instructions for the submission deadline.

<summary><strong>Concepts</strong></summary>

- question: Explain the difference between the VARCHAR(10) and CHAR(10) data types. When might CHAR be used?
- answer: VARCHAR(10) stores variable-length strings up to a maximum of 10 characters, using only the space needed for the actual string. CHAR(10) stores fixed-length strings of exactly 10 characters; shorter strings are padded with spaces, and it always uses the full 10 characters of storage. CHAR is typically used for short, fixed-length codes like country codes (CHAR(2)) or state abbreviations (CHAR(2)).

---

- question: Describe the two-step execution order when a subquery is used inside the WHERE clause of an outer query.
- answer:
Inner Query Execution: The database system first executes the subquery (inside the parentheses) which produces a result set.
Outer Query Execution: The database system then executes the outer query, using the result set from the subquery in its WHERE clause (or other clauses) as a filter or condition.

---

- question: Explain the purpose of the ORDER BY clause in SQL. What are the two sorting direction, and which one is the default if not specified?
- answer: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the results of a query based on one or more columns. The two sorting options mentioned are ASC (ascending order, A-Z, smallest to largest), which is the default, and DESC (descending order, Z-A, largest to smallest).

---

- question: What is the main purpose of the GROUP BY clause, and with which type of SQL function is it most powerfully used?
- answer: The GROUP BY clause groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. It is most powerfully used with Aggregate Functions, allowing calculations to be performed per group rather than on the entire table.

---

- question: Define what a database transaction is. Explain its primary purpose.
- answer: According to the lecture, a transaction is a sequence of one or more database operations (like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) treated as a single, logical unit of work. Its primary purpose is to ensure data integrity and maintain consistency by guaranteeing that related changes occur together or not at all, preventing partial updates.

---

- question: List the four properties represented by the acronym ACID. What is the overall goal of these properties?
- answer: The four properties represented by ACID are:
Atomicity,
Consistency,
Isolation,
Durability,
The overall goal of these properties is to ensure that database transactions are processed reliably, even in the presence of errors, power failures, or concurrent access.

---

- question: Explain the Consistency property ("C" in ACID). How does it relate to database rules like constraints (e.g., CHECK, NOT NULL)?
- answer: Consistency ensures that a transaction transitions the database from one valid state to another consistent state. It preserves all defined database rules (constraints) such as NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK constraints (like Balance >= 0), and Foreign Key relationships. If a transaction attempts an operation that would violate a constraint, it violates consistency and must be rolled back.

---


- question: What is the primary method recommended for controlling the order of operations in complex SQL expressions, and why is it beneficial even if the default precedence seems correct?
- answer: The primary method is using parentheses (). It's beneficial because it explicitly enforces the intended sequence, overrides default operator precedence, and significantly improves the readability and clarity of the code, reducing potential ambiguity and errors.

---

- question: Why is a single, centralized computer generally insufficient for handling the requirements of large-scale internet services like Google Search or Amazon? List two distinct reasons mentioned.
- answer: A single computer cannot handle the (1) massive data storage requirements and (2) the high processing load (billions of queries/transactions) and/or (3) the high availability requirements of these large-scale services. This necessitates distributing data and processing.

---

- question: Limitations of centralized databases. Explain the concept of "Vertical Scaling" and state one major drawback associated with it.
- answer: Vertical Scaling involves upgrading the central server (more CPU, RAM, faster disks). Drawbacks include physical limits (how big one machine can get) and becoming disproportionately expensive at the high end. 

---

- question: What are the key differences between a static website and a dynamic web application in terms of content generation and the need for a database?
- answer: Static websites have pre-written, fixed HTML content served directly by the web server, the same for all users, and updates require manual HTML editing. They typically don't require a database. Dynamic web applications generate content "on-the-fly" using server-side logic and database interaction, allowing for personalized, interactive, and real-time data experiences. Databases are essential for dynamic applications to manage persistent data.

---

- question: Why is Scalability considered a crucial database design consideration for web applications? Name one technique mentioned for achieving horizontal scaling.
- answer: Scalability is crucial because web applications often face massive and unpredictable user loads (e.g., viral content, sales events). The database must be designed to handle this growth. Designing for horizontal scaling (adding more machines) is prioritized over solely vertical scaling. Techniques mentioned for horizontal scaling include Replication or Sharding (Partitioning).

---

- question: Explain why Concurrency is a significant challenge for databases supporting web applications, and list one type of database mechanism used to manage it.
- answer: Concurrency is a challenge because a high number of web users may attempt to access and modify the same data simultaneously (e.g., booking the last seat, multiple users commenting). This requires mechanisms to manage simultaneous access and prevent data corruption. Database mechanisms mentioned include utilizing Concurrency Control Mechanisms like Locking (e.g., row-level) or setting appropriate Transaction Isolation Levels.

---

- question: What is the fundamental problem that Database Drivers and Database APIs aim to solve when connecting application code to a database?
- answer: The problem is how application code (written in various languages like Python, Java, PHP) can communicate reliably and effectively with different database management systems (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle), each having its own specific protocols and nuances. Applications need a standardized way to interact regardless of the underlying database. 

---

- question: What is SQL Injection (SQLi), and what coding practice makes applications vulnerable to it?
- answer: SQL Injection is an attack where malicious SQL code is inserted into application input, tricking the database into executing unintended commands. The coding practice that makes applications vulnerable is dynamically constructing SQL queries by concatenating strings that include unvalidated user input (e.g., `sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + userName + "'";`). 

---

- question: What is an SQL Injection attack, and which part of the system is primarily responsible for the vulnerability?
- answer: SQL Injection is an attack where malicious SQL code is inserted into application input fields. If the application improperly constructs SQL queries using this input, the malicious code gets executed by the database. The lecture notes this is primarily an application-level vulnerability.

---

- question: What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and why is it beneficial compared to assigning privileges directly?
- answer: RBAC involves grouping related privileges into logical ROLEs and assigning users to these roles. It's beneficial because it simplifies administration and improves consistency compared to assigning many individual privileges directly to each user.

---

- question: What is the primary purpose of a database index, and what real-world analogy was used to illustrate this?
- answer: The primary purpose of a database index is to speed up data retrieval operations (primarily SELECT queries) by providing faster lookup paths. Real-world analogies used were a book index, a library card catalog, or a phone book index, all of which allow direct access to information without a full sequential scan.

---

- question: What is the main difference in supported operations between a Hash index and a B-Tree index in PostgreSQL?
- answer: A Hash index primarily supports only equality (=) operations efficiently. A B-Tree index supports a wider range of operations, including equality (=), range queries (<, >, BETWEEN), and sorting (ORDER BY).

---

- question: For what kind of data values are GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) indexes particularly well-suited? Give one specific use case example mentioned.
- answer: GIN indexes are well-suited for indexing composite values (values containing multiple components). Use case examples mentioned include: searching elements within arrays, querying keys/values within JSONB, or full-text search.

---

- question: What is a key condition required for a BRIN (Block Range Index) to be highly effective?
- answer: A BRIN index is highly effective only when the indexed column's values have a strong physical correlation with the row storage order in the table (e.g., data naturally ordered on insertion like an auto-incrementing ID or timestamp).

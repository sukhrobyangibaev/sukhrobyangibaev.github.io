## Using the pgAdmin 4 ERD Tool for Database Design

---

### Prerequisites

- **pgAdmin 4 Installed:** Ensure you have installed and configured pgAdmin 4.
- **Database Connection:** Verify that you can connect to a PostgreSQL server.
- **Basic SQL Knowledge:** Familiarity with tables, primary keys, and foreign keys is assumed. This material should have been covered in your lectures.

---

### Step 1: Launch pgAdmin 4 and Open the ERD Tool

- **Start pgAdmin 4:** Launch pgAdmin 4 and connect to your PostgreSQL server.

- **Open ERD Tool:**
    - In the main pgAdmin window, from the menu bar select **Tools > ERD Tool**.
    - An empty canvas will open in a new tab where you can design your ER diagram.

### Step 2: Create a New ERD Project and Add Your First Table

- **Add a Table:**
    - Click the **Add Table** button (usually represented by a plus icon on the toolbar).
    - A dialog window will appear asking for table details.

- **Define Table Properties:**
    - **Table Name:** Enter a descriptive name (e.g., `Employee`).

![](/assets/images/2025-02-13-db-prac-2/Pasted%20image%2020250212145820.png)

- **Columns Tab:** Switch to the Columns tab.
	- Add columns one by one by clicking the “Add” (or plus) icon.
	
![](/assets/images/2025-02-13-db-prac-2/Pasted%20image%2020250212145959.png)
- For example, add:
	- `emp_id` (data type: **integer**, set as **Primary Key**),
	- `first_name` (data type: **character varying**),
	- `last_name` (data type: **character varying**),
	- `email` (data type: **character varying**).
- **Save the Table:** Click **Save** to add the table to the canvas.

---

### Step 3: Add a Second Table and Define Its Structure

- **Repeat the Process:**
    - Click the **Add Table** button again.
    - Create a second table (e.g., `Employee_Address`) with columns such as:
        - `address_id` (data type: **integer**, set as **Primary Key**),
        - `emp_id` (data type: **integer**, to link with the `Employee` table),
        - `street` (data type: **character varying**),
        - `city` (data type: **character varying**),
        - `zip_code` (data type: **character varying**).
- **Save the Second Table:**  
    Click **Save**. The new table will appear on the ERD canvas.
    - If tables overlap, use drag-and-drop to reposition them.

---

### Step 4: Establish Relationships Between Tables

- **Define a Foreign Key Relationship:**
    - **Select the Table:** Click on the `Employee_Address` table node.
    - **Initiate Relationship Creation:**
        - Click on the **1M (one-to-many)** button on the toolbar. This signifies that one record in the `Employee` table can link to multiple addresses.

- **Fill in the Relationship Dialog:**
	- **Local Table:** `Employee_Address`
	- **Local Column:** Select `emp_id` (the column that will store the reference).
	- **Referenced Table:** `Employee`
	- **Referenced Column:** Select `emp_id` (the primary key in the `Employee` table).
        
![](/assets/images/2025-02-13-db-prac-2/Pasted%20image%2020250212150903.png)

- **Save the Relationship:**  
	Once confirmed, a connecting line appears between the two tables, graphically representing the foreign key constraint.

### Step 5: Create a Project Table

- **Add a Table:**
    - Click the **Add Table** button.
    - A dialog window will appear asking for table details.
- **Define Table Properties for the Project Table:**
    - **Table Name:** Enter `Project`.
    - **Columns Tab:** Add columns such as:
        - `project_id` (data type: **integer**, set as **Primary Key**),
        - `project_name` (data type: **character varying**).
- **Save the Project Table:**  
    Click **Save**. The `Project` table will now appear on the ERD canvas.

### Step 6: Creating a Many-to-Many Relationship

- **Create an Intersection Table:**
    - Click the **Add Table** button.
    - Name it `Employee_Project` (this table will link employees to projects).
    - Add columns:
        - `employee_id` (data type: **integer**, foreign key referencing `Employee(emp_id)`),
        - `project_id` (data type: **integer**, foreign key referencing `Project(project_id)`).
		- Set both columns as a **composite primary key** by selecting them together.

- **Define the Relationships:**

![](/assets/images/2025-02-13-db-prac-2/Pasted%20image%2020250212152428.png)

- Link `Employee_Project.employee_id` to `Employee.emp_id` (one-to-many relationship).

![](/assets/images/2025-02-13-db-prac-2/Pasted%20image%2020250212152514.png)

- Link `Employee_Project.project_id` to `Project.project_id` (one-to-many relationship).

![](/assets/images/2025-02-13-db-prac-2/Pasted%20image%2020250212152545.png)

- This setup ensures that an employee can be assigned to multiple projects and a project can have multiple employees, forming a **many-to-many** relationship.

![](/assets/images/2025-02-13-db-prac-2/Pasted%20image%2020250212152658.png)

- **Save and Review the Diagram:**
    - Ensure that the relationships are correctly represented with connecting lines.

### Step 7: Enhance the ERD with Additional Features

- **Auto-Align Tables:**
    - Click the **Auto Align** icon on the toolbar to tidy up the layout. This rearranges the tables for clearer visualization.

- **Add Notes & Color Coding:**
- Use the **Add/Edit Note** button to attach annotations to tables.

![](/assets/images/2025-02-13-db-prac-2/Pasted%20image%2020250212152956.png)

- Change node colors with the **Fill Color** option to group related tables or highlight specific sections.

![](/assets/images/2025-02-13-db-prac-2/Pasted%20image%2020250212153116.png)

- **Generate SQL DDL:**
    - Click the **Generate SQL** button (SQL icon).
    - A query tool window opens with the SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) script generated from your diagram.
    - This SQL can be used to recreate the database schema.

- **Save Your ERD Project:**
    - Click the **Save** icon or use the shortcut (Ctrl + S).
    - Provide a file name and choose a location to save your ERD diagram so that you can re-open and edit it later.

## Combining Multiple Tables with JOINs in PostgreSQL

**Objectives:**
1.  Understand the need for JOINs in relational databases.
2.  Explain the different types of JOINs: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`, and `CROSS JOIN`.
3.  Write SQL queries using each type of JOIN in PostgreSQL.
4.  Execute JOIN queries using pgAdmin 4.
5.  Interpret the results of JOIN queries and understand how data is combined from multiple tables.

### 1. Sample Database Setup

Let's create a simple database with two tables to illustrate JOINs. We'll use tables named `students` and `courses`.

**Create the `students` table.**
Execute the following SQL command in the query editor:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    major VARCHAR(50)
);
```

**Create the `courses` table.**
Execute the following SQL command in the query editor:

```sql
CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    credits INTEGER
);
```

**Populate the tables with sample data.**
Execute the following `INSERT` statements to add some data to our tables:

```sql
INSERT INTO students (student_name, major) VALUES
('KOMILJONOV AZIMJON HAMIDBEKOVICH', 'Computer Science'),
('OTAJONOV SHOHZODBEK QAXRAMON O‘G‘LI', 'Mathematics'),
('OTANAZAROV SULTONBEK O‘KTAM O‘G‘LI', 'Physics'),
('QURAMBOYEV DIYORBEK RASHID O‘G‘LI', 'Chemistry'),
('RAXMONBERGANOV XAYRULLO MAXMUD O‘G‘LI', 'Chemistry'),
('SHONAZAROV AZIZBEK XUSHNUDBEK O‘G‘LI', 'Biology');

INSERT INTO courses (course_name, credits) VALUES
('Introduction to Programming', 3),
('Calculus I', 4),
('Classical Mechanics', 3),
('Organic Chemistry', 4),
('Genetics', 3),
('Data Structures', 3);
```

**Add a linking column to represent student enrollment.**
Execute the following `ALTER TABLE` command:

```sql
ALTER TABLE courses
ADD COLUMN student_id INTEGER REFERENCES students(student_id);
```

This command adds a new column `student_id` to the `courses` table.  It's of type `INTEGER` and establishes a foreign key relationship with the `student_id` column in the `students` table. This means that the `student_id` in the `courses` table must either be `NULL` or match an existing `student_id` in the `students` table.

**Update the `courses` table to link courses to students.**

Now, let's update the `courses` table to indicate which student is enrolled in each course.  Note that not all courses will be linked to a student in this example, demonstrating different JOIN behaviours later.

```sql
UPDATE courses SET student_id = 1 WHERE course_id IN (1, 6);
UPDATE courses SET student_id = 2 WHERE course_id IN (2); 
UPDATE courses SET student_id = 3 WHERE course_id IN (3); 
UPDATE courses SET student_id = 4 WHERE course_id IN (4); 
```

We now have two tables, `students` and `courses`, with a relationship established through the `student_id` column in the `courses` table. Let's explore different types of JOINs to combine data from these tables.

### 2. Types of JOINs

There are several types of JOINs in SQL, each designed for different scenarios of combining data. We'll cover the most common ones:

*   **INNER JOIN**: Returns rows only when there is a match in *both* tables based on the join condition.
*   **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all rows from the *left* table and the matching rows from the *right* table. If there's no match in the right table, it returns `NULL` values for the columns from the right table.
*   **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all rows from the *right* table and the matching rows from the *left* table. If there's no match in the left table, it returns `NULL` values for the columns from the left table.
*   **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Returns all rows from *both* tables. If there's a match, rows are combined. If there's no match in one table, `NULL` values are used for the columns from the other table.
*   **CROSS JOIN**: Returns the Cartesian product of all rows from both tables. It combines every row from the first table with every row from the second table.

Let's examine each type with examples using our `students` and `courses` tables.

**INNER JOIN**
**Purpose:**  To retrieve rows where there is a match in both tables based on a specified condition.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2 ON join_condition;
```
*   `table1` and `table2` are the tables you want to join.
*   `join_condition` specifies how the tables should be related. It's usually based on a common column between the tables. In our case, it will be `students.student_id = courses.student_id`.

**Example:**  Let's find the names of students and the courses they are enrolled in.
Execute the following query in pgAdmin 4:
```sql
SELECT students.student_name, courses.course_name
FROM students
INNER JOIN courses ON students.student_id = courses.student_id;
```

**Explanation:**
*   We are selecting `student_name` from the `students` table and `course_name` from the `courses` table.
*   `FROM students INNER JOIN courses`: We are specifying that we want to join the `students` and `courses` tables using an `INNER JOIN`.
*   `ON students.student_id = courses.student_id`: This is the join condition. It specifies that we want to match rows where the `student_id` in the `students` table is equal to the `student_id` in the `courses` table.

**Result:**
You will see a table like this in the "Data output" pane of pgAdmin 4:

![](/assets/images/2025-03-20-db-prac-7/Pasted%20image%2020250316093823.png)

**Interpretation:** The `INNER JOIN` only returned rows where there was a matching `student_id` in both the `students` and `courses` tables. Courses like 'Genetics' which are not associated with any student (i.e., student_id is NULL or not matching) and students like 'RAXMONBERGANOV XAYRULLO MAXMUD O‘G‘LI' who are not explicitly linked to courses in our current setup are not included in the result.

**LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)**
**Purpose:** To retrieve all rows from the *left* table and matching rows from the *right* table. If there is no match in the right table, it still includes the row from the left table, but with `NULL` values for the columns from the right table.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2 ON join_condition;
```
*   `table1` is considered the *left* table, and `table2` is the *right* table in a `LEFT JOIN`.

**Example:** Let's list all students and, if they are enrolled in a course, show the course name.
Execute the following query in pgAdmin 4:
```sql
SELECT students.student_name, courses.course_name
FROM students
LEFT JOIN courses ON students.student_id = courses.student_id;
```

**Explanation:**
*   We are using `LEFT JOIN` with `students` as the left table and `courses` as the right table.
*   The query will return all rows from the `students` table.
*   For each student, if there's a matching `student_id` in the `courses` table, it will also retrieve the `course_name`.
*   If a student is not enrolled in any course (according to our data), the `course_name` will be `NULL`.

**Result:**

![](/assets/images/2025-03-20-db-prac-7/Pasted%20image%2020250316094006.png)

**Interpretation:** Notice that 'RAXMONBERGANOV XAYRULLO MAXMUD O‘G‘LI' and 'SHONAZAROV AZIZBEK XUSHNUDBEK O‘G‘LI' are included in the result, even though she is not associated with any course in our `courses` table (no matching `student_id`). The `course_name` is `NULL`, indicating no course is linked for this student based on the join condition.

**RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**
**Purpose:** To retrieve all rows from the *right* table and matching rows from the *left* table. If there is no match in the left table, it still includes the row from the right table, but with `NULL` values for the columns from the left table.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2 ON join_condition;
```

*   `table1` is the *left* table, and `table2` is the *right* table in a `RIGHT JOIN`.

**Example:** Let's list all courses and, if a student is enrolled, show the student's name.
Execute the following query in pgAdmin 4:
```sql
SELECT students.student_name, courses.course_name
FROM students
RIGHT JOIN courses ON students.student_id = courses.student_id;
```

**Explanation:**
*   We are using `RIGHT JOIN` with `students` as the left table and `courses` as the right table.
*   The query will return all rows from the `courses` table.
*   For each course, if there's a matching `student_id` in the `students` table, it will also retrieve the `student_name`.
*   If a course is not associated with any student (although in our example, all courses *are* linked in some way, let's imagine if 'Genetics' was not linked), the `student_name` would be `NULL`.

**Result:**

![](/assets/images/2025-03-20-db-prac-7/Pasted%20image%2020250316094024.png)

**Interpretation:**  'Genetics' is included in the result, even though we haven't explicitly linked it to a student in our `students` table for this demonstration.  Since our current data links all courses to some student, the practical difference between `RIGHT JOIN` and `INNER JOIN` in this specific dataset is that `RIGHT JOIN` will include courses even if they hypothetically weren't linked to any student (which is not the case in our current data setup, but conceptually important).  If 'Genetics' had `student_id` as `NULL` or an ID not in `students`, and we wanted to see it in the result, `RIGHT JOIN` would ensure it appears.

**FULL OUTER JOIN**
**Purpose:** To retrieve all rows from both the left and right tables. For matching rows, columns are combined. For non-matching rows from the left table, right table columns will be `NULL`, and for non-matching rows from the right table, left table columns will be `NULL`.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2 ON join_condition;
```

**Example:** Let's see all students and all courses, showing matches where they exist and `NULL` where they don't.
Execute the following query in pgAdmin 4:
```sql
SELECT students.student_name, courses.course_name
FROM students
FULL OUTER JOIN courses ON students.student_id = courses.student_id;
```

**Explanation:**
*   `FULL OUTER JOIN` combines the effects of `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`.
*   It will include all students and all courses.
*   Where there's a match based on `student_id`, the rows will be combined.
*   For students without a matching course (in our current setup, all students are linked to at least one course), and for courses without a matching student (again, in our setup, all courses are linked), you would see `NULL` values in the columns from the table without a match.

**Result:**

![](/assets/images/2025-03-20-db-prac-7/Pasted%20image%2020250316094103.png)

**Interpretation:** This result shows all students and all courses. 'SHONAZAROV AZIZBEK XUSHNUDBEK O‘G‘LI', who is not linked to a course, appears with `course_name` as `NULL`. 'Genetics', which we can imagine might not be linked to a student in some scenarios, appears with `student_name` as `NULL`.  `FULL OUTER JOIN` ensures that no row from either table is lost in the result.

**CROSS JOIN**
**Purpose:** To perform a Cartesian product of the two tables. This means every row from the first table is combined with every row from the second table.  It's generally used less frequently than other JOIN types and can result in very large result sets if tables are large.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

**Note:** `CROSS JOIN` does not use an `ON` condition because it combines every row with every other row, regardless of any relationship.
**Example:** Let's see all possible combinations of students and courses.
Execute the following query in pgAdmin 4:
```sql
SELECT students.student_name, courses.course_name
FROM students
CROSS JOIN courses;
```

**Explanation:**
*   `CROSS JOIN` combines each student with every course.
*   If you have 5 students and 6 courses, the result will have 6 * 6 = 36 rows.
**Result:** (Only a partial result is shown due to length)

![](/assets/images/2025-03-20-db-prac-7/Pasted%20image%2020250316094334.png)

**Interpretation:** The result is a list of every possible pairing of a student with a course.  `CROSS JOIN` is useful in specific situations, such as generating all possible combinations for testing or analysis, but it's crucial to understand its behaviour to avoid unintentionally creating extremely large result sets.

### 3. Aliases for Tables

When writing JOIN queries, especially with multiple tables or when referring to the same table multiple times (though not covered in P8), it's good practice to use aliases for table names to make queries shorter and more readable.

**Example (using INNER JOIN with aliases):**
```sql
SELECT s.student_name, c.course_name
FROM students AS s
INNER JOIN courses AS c ON s.student_id = c.student_id;
```

In this example, `s` is an alias for `students`, and `c` is an alias for `courses`. You can use these aliases throughout the query instead of the full table names.

### 4. `WHERE` Clause with JOINs

You can combine JOINs with `WHERE` clauses to further filter the results. The `WHERE` clause is applied *after* the JOIN operation has been performed.

**Example:**  Find the names of Computer Science students and the courses they are enrolled in.
```sql
SELECT s.student_name, c.course_name
FROM students AS s
INNER JOIN courses AS c ON s.student_id = c.student_id
WHERE s.major = 'Computer Science';
```

![](/assets/images/2025-03-20-db-prac-7/Pasted%20image%2020250319092507.png)

**Explanation:**
*   This query first performs an `INNER JOIN` between `students` and `courses`.
*   Then, the `WHERE` clause filters the result to only include rows where the `major` in the `students` table is 'Computer Science'.

### 5. Using `COALESCE()` to Handle NULL Values in JOIN Results

When using `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, or `FULL OUTER JOIN`, you might encounter `NULL` values in your result set, especially for columns from the table that might not have a match. The `COALESCE()` function is very useful for replacing these `NULL` values with more meaningful or user-friendly values.

**Purpose of `COALESCE()`:**
The `COALESCE()` function returns the first non-NULL expression in a list of expressions.  It takes multiple arguments and evaluates them in order until it finds the first one that is not `NULL`, and then returns that value. If all arguments are `NULL`, `COALESCE()` will return `NULL`.

**Syntax:**
```sql
COALESCE(expression1, expression2, expression3, ...);
```

**Example with `LEFT JOIN`:**
In our `LEFT JOIN` example, we displayed all students and their enrolled courses. For students not enrolled in any course, the `course_name` was shown as `NULL`. Let's use `COALESCE()` to replace this `NULL` with the text 'Not enrolled in any course'.

Execute the following query in pgAdmin 4:
```sql
SELECT s.student_name, COALESCE(c.course_name, 'Not enrolled in any course') AS course_name
FROM students AS s
LEFT JOIN courses AS c ON s.student_id = c.student_id;
```

**Explanation:**
*   `COALESCE(c.course_name, 'Not enrolled in any course')`:  This part of the query checks the `c.course_name` (which is `courses.course_name` due to alias `c`).
    *   If `c.course_name` is not `NULL` (meaning the student is enrolled in a course), `COALESCE()` will return the actual `course_name`.
    *   If `c.course_name` is `NULL` (meaning the student is not enrolled in a course in our `courses` table), `COALESCE()` will return the second argument, which is the string `'Not enrolled in any course'`.
*   `AS course_name`: We are using an alias `course_name` for the result of the `COALESCE()` function, so the output column will still be named `course_name`.

**Result:**

![](/assets/images/2025-03-20-db-prac-7/Pasted%20image%2020250319092234.png)

**Interpretation:**
Now, instead of seeing `NULL` for students who are not enrolled in a course, you see 'Not enrolled in any course'. This makes the output more readable and informative. `COALESCE()` is a powerful function for handling `NULL` values and providing default values in your query results, especially when working with JOINs that can introduce `NULL` values. You can use `COALESCE()` with more than two expressions to check for multiple potential `NULL` values and provide a fallback option.

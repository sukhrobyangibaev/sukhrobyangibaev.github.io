## Using UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT in PostgreSQL

### Introduction to Set Operations
Set operations in SQL treat the results of `SELECT` statements like mathematical sets, allowing you to combine or compare them. The three operations we will cover are:

- **UNION**: Combines the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements into a single result set, removing duplicate rows.
- **INTERSECT**: Returns only the rows that appear in all specified `SELECT` statements.
- **EXCEPT**: Returns the rows from the first `SELECT` statement that do not appear in the subsequent `SELECT` statements.

---

### Setting Up Sample Tables
To demonstrate these operations, we will use two simple tables: `math_enrollments` and `science_enrollments`. Each table lists students enrolled in math or science courses, with columns for `student_id` (integer) and `student_name` (text).

Run the following SQL commands in the pgAdmin 4 SQL editor to create and populate these tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE math_enrollments (
    student_id integer,
    student_name text
);

CREATE TABLE science_enrollments (
    student_id integer,
    student_name text
);

INSERT INTO math_enrollments (student_id, student_name) VALUES
(1, 'AZIMJON'),
(2, 'SHOHZODBEK'),
(3, 'SULTONBEK');

INSERT INTO science_enrollments (student_id, student_name) VALUES
(2, 'SHOHZODBEK'),
(4, 'XAYRULLO'),
(5, 'AZIZBEK');
```

After executing these commands, your tables are ready. In pgAdmin 4, the output will confirm the tables are created and data is inserted successfully.

### UNION: Combining Results
The `UNION` operation combines the results of two or more `SELECT` statements into a single result set, automatically removing duplicates.

#### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table2;
```

#### Example
To get a list of all students enrolled in either math or science:

```sql
SELECT student_id, student_name FROM math_enrollments
UNION
SELECT student_id, student_name FROM science_enrollments;
```

Execute this query in pgAdmin 4. The result appears in the **Data Output** tab:

![](/assets/images/2025-03-14-db-prac-6/Pasted%20image%2020250312081834.png)

#### Explanation
- The result includes all unique students from both tables.
- Bob, who is in both `math_enrollments` and `science_enrollments`, appears only once because `UNION` removes duplicates.

#### UNION ALL Variant
If you want to include duplicates (if they exist), use `UNION ALL`:

```sql
SELECT student_id, student_name FROM math_enrollments
UNION ALL
SELECT student_id, student_name FROM science_enrollments;
```

![](/assets/images/2025-03-14-db-prac-6/Pasted%20image%2020250312081901.png)

In our sample data, there are no duplicate rows, so the result is identical to `UNION`. However, `UNION ALL` runs faster because it does not check for duplicates.

---

### INTERSECT: Finding Common Rows
The `INTERSECT` operation returns only the rows that appear in all specified `SELECT` statements.

#### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table1
INTERSECT
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table2;
```

#### Example
To find students enrolled in both math and science:

```sql
SELECT student_id, student_name FROM math_enrollments
INTERSECT
SELECT student_id, student_name FROM science_enrollments;
```

Execute this query. The result is:

![](/assets/images/2025-03-14-db-prac-6/Pasted%20image%2020250312081935.png)

#### Explanation
- Only Bob appears in both tables, so he is the sole row returned.
- `INTERSECT` compares entire rows, so both `student_id` and `student_name` must match.

---

### EXCEPT: Finding Differences
The `EXCEPT` operation returns rows from the first `SELECT` statement that do not appear in the second `SELECT` statement.

#### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table1
EXCEPT
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table2;
```

#### Example 1: Math but Not Science
To find students enrolled in math but not in science:

```sql
SELECT student_id, student_name FROM math_enrollments
EXCEPT
SELECT student_id, student_name FROM science_enrollments;
```

Result:

![](/assets/images/2025-03-14-db-prac-6/Pasted%20image%2020250312081959.png)

#### Example 2: Science but Not Math
To find students enrolled in science but not in math:

```sql
SELECT student_id, student_name FROM science_enrollments
EXCEPT
SELECT student_id, student_name FROM math_enrollments;
```

Result:

![](/assets/images/2025-03-14-db-prac-6/Pasted%20image%2020250312082020.png)

#### Explanation
- In Example 1, Alice and Charlie are in `math_enrollments` but not in `science_enrollments`.
- In Example 2, David and Eve are in `science_enrollments` but not in `math_enrollments`.
- The order of `SELECT` statements matters with `EXCEPT`, unlike `UNION` and `INTERSECT`.

### Key Requirements and Notes
To use set operations successfully in PostgreSQL:
1. **Column Count**: Each `SELECT` statement must return the same number of columns.
2. **Data Types**: Corresponding columns must have compatible data types (e.g., integer with integer, text with text).
3. **Column Names**: The result set uses column names from the **first** `SELECT` statement.
4. **Duplicates**: `UNION` and `INTERSECT` remove duplicates; use `ALL` (e.g., `UNION ALL`) to keep them.
5. **Multiple Operations**: You can chain operations, e.g., `SELECT ... UNION SELECT ... UNION SELECT ...`.

#### Common Pitfalls
- **Mismatched Columns**: This fails:
  ```sql
SELECT student_id FROM math_enrollments
UNION
SELECT student_name FROM science_enrollments;
  ```
  Error: Data types (integer vs. text) do not match.
- **Different Column Counts**: This fails:
  ```sql
SELECT student_id, student_name FROM math_enrollments
UNION
SELECT student_id FROM science_enrollments;
  ```
  Error: Unequal number of columns.

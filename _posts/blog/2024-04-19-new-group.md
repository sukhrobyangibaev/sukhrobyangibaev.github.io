Forming new groups mid-semester is a bad idea.

Consider this hypothetical scenario: An original group consists of ~6 students. Then the administration decides to create another group with ~11 students and merge classes between these two groups. This creates a combined class with ~17 students â€” nearly triple the original size.

This type of merger significantly increases teachers' workload. They must:
- Check three times more homework assignments
- Grade three times more exams
- Provide feedback to nearly triple the number of students
- Adapt their teaching style to accommodate larger classes

Someone could say that 6 students is too small a group and teachers should not complain about having 17 students. However, this misses a crucial point: it is the middle of the semester, and many aspects of the educational style must be changed abruptly. Teaching methods that work well for a small, intimate group of 6 students are very different from those needed for a larger group of 17.

Teachers often feel overwhelmed by sudden increases in responsibilities without additional compensation or preparation time. It is not about money. If you were to ask a teacher, "We will add some students to your class and add some compensation to your salary," some would answer, "No thank you, please leave things as they were."

Such mergers create social and academic challenges for everyone involved:

For original students:
- Less individual attention from teachers
- Longer wait times for feedback
- Disrupted class dynamics

For new students:
- Difficulty adapting to different requirements than they're used to
- Pressure to fit in with established group members
- Frustration when asked to follow unfamiliar procedures

New students often try to establish their position in the social hierarchy by acting out or challenging authority. Rather than focusing on learning, they spend energy trying to navigate new social dynamics.

The fundamental issue is that administrators who make these decisions won't experience the negative consequences. They don't have to:
- Teach larger classes
- Grade extra assignments
- Deal with classroom management issues
- Adapt to new social dynamics

Decision-makers should not restructure academic groups mid-semester without considering how it affects teachers and students. Furthermore, those who make such decisions should be held accountable for the results. Teachers and students deserve better planning and consideration when administrative changes are made.

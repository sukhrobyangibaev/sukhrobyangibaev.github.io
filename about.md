Hi, I'm Sukhrob! ðŸ‘‹

I regularly use:
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for Markdown note-taking.
- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for spaced repetition learning.
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) / [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) for coding.
- [AIChat](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat) for accessing LLMs in the terminal.

Some blogs I recommend checking out:
- [George Hotz's Blog](https://geohot.github.io/blog/)
- [Paul Graham's Essays](https://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html)
